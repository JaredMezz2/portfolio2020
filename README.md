My New Portfolio Site (SPA) https://jaredmezz.com

- HTML/CSS
- Angular
- Typescript
- jQuery/Javascript
- Boostrap Framework for Styling

I decided to redo my portfolio website as it's been a couple years and I usually get inspired while doing so. This time around I decided to make it using Angular and frame it as a Single Page Application (SPA). This was my first time using Angular as well as Typescript so I definitelty found a learing curve to it, but I feel as if this was a solid introduction into the Framework. 

Unline the Resume & Contact tabs that are buttons, the Portfolio and Links tab bring up/down menus of respective components. The data is stored in a local JSON file on the server and it's read upon load. 

This is also mobile friendly, feel free to try it out!
